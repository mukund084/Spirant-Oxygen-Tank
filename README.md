# Spirant-Oxygen-Tank

What is the problem? 

Mountaineers carry heavy oxygen tanks when they’re climbing up mountains, and many of the first aid kits they carry don’t have a device for transferring oxygen for emergency cases. Many of the oxygen tanks use a long process for producing oxygen, where refilling isn't a reliable option for long climbs.  
Many first aid kits don't have an emergency oxygen option, making it difficult for treating those who are facing an urgent crisis with the respiratory system. The extra dosage of oxygen can help prolong life of those in a crisis, helping in saving the lives of many individuals who suffer from medical emergencies. 

SPIRANT: Oxygen Tank 

This is a unique oxygen tank which produces oxygen gas with the help of hydrogen peroxide reacting with potassium permanganate.  This device will contain a predetermined amount of Hydrogen peroxide in the bottle and small bags of potassium permanganate. This will make it easy and quick to use in emergency situations. 
Its small form factor is specifically meant for medical first aid kits providing them compact solution for using oxygen as a medicine.  It has an appealing design, prevents younger patients from being scared of the device.
